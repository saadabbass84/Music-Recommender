This project goes through the steps of exploring how to build a recommender for music apps.

Notebook 01 will focus on the Exploratory Data Analysis for the datasets.

Notebook 02 will go through the steps to create a recommender system using Content-based algorithms and the SVD model from the Scikit-Surprise library.
